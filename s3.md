# S3

S3 is an Amazon Web Service that we will be using for this event to store the data we'll be working with. Access to these datasets will be provided to your teams via a place holder link.

Refer to [Datasets](datasets.md) for the list of datasets with their associated link.

If you have brought some of your own data that you would like to work with then here are couple of simple steps to help you get it into an S3 bucket.

**Step 1**<br>
Search for "S3" in the AWS console<br>

**Step 4**<br>
Name your bucket, here we are using lot-of-data-bucket as our name, be sure to follow the [rules for naming buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html?icmpid=docs_amazons3_console).<br>

Remember to follow these [rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html?icmpid=docs_amazons3_console) when naming your folder. In this case we are calling the new folder: "KoalaData". Once done, select "Create Folder at the bottom".
